#### **Introduction**:
I am currently studying Mathematical Statistics by "Woochul Kim" and Regression Analysis(Linear models in Statistics) by Alvin Rencher to prepare for graduate school in Statistics. While I am not yet focused on a specific field within Statistics, I am interested in both theoretical and applied aspects of the discipline. After the entrance exam, I plan to study Mathematical Analysis and Advanced Linear Algebra and participate in a data analysis contest.
